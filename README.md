## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework


### What I Learned

In this project, I focused on key areas to improve the overall accessibility, structure, and responsiveness of the website:

- **Keyboard Navigation**: I ensured that all interactive elements, such as links and buttons, are accessible via keyboard navigation. This involved using semantic HTML elements and ensuring that each element can be reached and activated through the `Tab` key, enhancing usability for keyboard-only users.

- **Semantic HTML and Content Hierarchy**: I prioritized the use of semantic HTML to improve the content structure and hierarchy. By using elements like `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`, I created a clear, accessible structure that allows assistive technologies to better interpret and navigate the content.

- **Responsive Design**: I implemented responsive design techniques to ensure that the content adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices. This included using Tailwind CSS's responsive utility classes to create adaptable layout across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.


## Continued Development

As the project evolves, several enhancements and features are planned to improve functionality and user experience:

 - **Improve performance**: Implement server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) where applicable.
 - **Advanced accessibility**: Add ARIA roles and keyboard navigation to all interactive elements.
